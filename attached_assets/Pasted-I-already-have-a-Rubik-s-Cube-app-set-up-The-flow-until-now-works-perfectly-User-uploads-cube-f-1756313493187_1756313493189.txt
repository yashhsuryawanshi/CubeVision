I already have a Rubik‚Äôs Cube app set up. The flow until now works perfectly:
- User uploads cube face pictures.
- The Roboflow model (https://universe.roboflow.com/dhyan-thacker/rubiks-cube-colors/model/1) detects sticker colors.
- The cube is reconstructed and displayed as a 3D model.

‚úÖ Do not change or break any of the existing logic. Everything up to the 3D model is working fine. Just continue from there.

Now I want to add the **solving and learning functionality**:

1. **Two Solving Options**:
   - Beginner "Layer-by-Layer" method (teaching-focused).
   - Advanced "Kociemba Two-Phase Algorithm" (short solutions).

   Add a toggle so the user can select which method to use.

2. **Step-by-Step Learning Interface**:
   - Must integrate with the current 3D cube model.
   - Display the current step name (e.g., "Solve White Cross").
   - Show the move notation (`R`, `U'`, `F2`) for each step.
   - Provide play, pause, next, and previous controls.
   - Show progress (Step X of Y).
   - Keep styling consistent with the current theme.

3. **3D Cube Animation**:
   - Animate cube layer rotations smoothly (like a real cube).
   - Highlight which layer will move before animating it.
   - Keep cube state in sync with moves.
   - Allow speed adjustment for animations.

4. **Extra Features for Learning**:
   - Beginner mode should also show text-based explanations (e.g., ‚ÄúInsert the white corner using R' D' R D‚Äù).
   - Advanced mode skips explanations and just shows moves + animations.
   - Option to restart the solution or skip to a specific step.

5. **Technical Continuation**:
   - Keep using React + Three.js (React Three Fiber) + Tailwind (matching current theme).
   - Do not replace or rework the color detection flow ‚Äî just build on top of it.
   - Keep a clean modular structure (extend with new components):
     - `Solver.ts` ‚Üí generate move sequences (Beginner + Kociemba).
     - `LearningPanel.tsx` ‚Üí UI for step instructions, controls, progress.
     - `CubeAnimator.tsx` ‚Üí animate moves on the existing 3D model.
   - Integrate these with the current cube rendering and detection pipeline.

6. **Deliverable**:
   - After the cube is reconstructed, user can choose solver type.
   - Step-by-step solving begins, with smooth animations and explanations.
   - Everything must feel like a natural continuation of the current app, without disturbing the flow that already works.

üöÄ Implement this continuation inside my existing Replit project without altering the working parts (upload ‚Üí Roboflow detection ‚Üí 3D cube display). Just add the solving + learning layer exactly as described.
