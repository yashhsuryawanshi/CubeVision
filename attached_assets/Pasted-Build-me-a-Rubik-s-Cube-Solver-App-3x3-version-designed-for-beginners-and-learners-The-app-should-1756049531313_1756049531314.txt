Build me a Rubik’s Cube Solver App (3x3 version) designed for beginners and learners. The app should be interactive, educational, and visually engaging.

🔑 Core Features & Workflow

Onboarding / Home Screen

A clean welcome screen introducing the app: "Solve your Rubik’s Cube step by step."

Simple navigation buttons: Start Scanning, Tutorials, About the Cube, My Saved Cubes.

Image Upload & Cube Face Capture

Users can upload or capture images of the 6 faces of their 3x3 Rubik’s Cube.

Each uploaded image is processed by my custom color detection model (from Roboflow).

Ensure consistent cube face orientation instructions (with visual guides so users don’t upload faces in the wrong order).

Color Detection & Correction

Automatically detect cube colors from the uploaded images.

Display a 2D grid preview of the cube face after detection.

Allow users to manually correct any wrongly detected colors by clicking/tapping squares and selecting from a color palette (6 standard Rubik’s colors).

3D Cube Visualization

After all 6 faces are uploaded and confirmed, render a 3D interactive Rubik’s Cube model.

Users should be able to rotate and zoom in/out on the cube.

Updated colors should reflect immediately on the 3D model.

Solver (Later Integration)

Placeholder for the solving algorithm.

For now, just show: “Solver coming soon. For now, explore your cube in 3D!”

Future-ready: accept the cube state and output solving steps with 3D animations.

Learning & Education Section

A section with beginner tutorials: “How to Hold the Cube”, “Basic Notations (R, L, U, D, F, B)”, and “Beginner’s Solving Method”.

Option to practice moves with an interactive virtual cube.

User Experience Improvements

Save and reload scanned cubes.

Light/Dark mode.

Error handling (e.g., if a cube state is invalid, prompt user to fix colors).

Smooth transitions & animations when moving between steps.

🎨 Design & UI

Use a modern, clean, minimalistic design with a focus on interactivity.

3D cube should be the centerpiece with soft shadows and smooth animations.

Tailwind-style UI elements: rounded buttons, color-coded indicators, clear typography.

🚀 Stretch Features (Optional, Nice-to-Have)

AR Mode: Allow scanning the cube in real-time using the phone’s camera.

Share Feature: Share your cube’s state or solving steps with friends.

Achievements: Gamify learning by tracking solved cubes, fastest uploads, etc.
